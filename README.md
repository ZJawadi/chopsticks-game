# chopsticks-game

This is a coded version of the childhood game chopsticks, where two players use their fingers to represent "chopsticks." They can either attack or move. Once a player reaches five chopsticks on one hand, that hand is out. The goal is to get the player to lose both hands. It's a simple game that employs strategy but is simple and easy to understand.
